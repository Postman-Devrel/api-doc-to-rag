# API Documentation Generator - Frontend

Beautiful Vue.js frontend for the API Documentation Generator.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173` with hot reload.

3. Build for production:

npm run build
```

This builds the app and outputs to `../dist/` directory, which the Express server will serve in production.
